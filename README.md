Word Puzzle Site
Word Puzzle Site for Epicodus Level2 Java Project 1

By Ililochi Onwuzu

Description

This site presents a game with two players: Guesser and Coordinator. In the home page, the Coordinator inputs a string of word(s). In the next page (/showPuzzle), a new string is shown with the vowels in the Coordinator's string hidden. Guesser then inputs a string to try to guess the coordinators string. If it matches, the Guesser wins the game. If not, the Coordinator wins. The code was designed using BDD testing principles and was testing in gradle using Junit for the business logic and Fluentinum for the integration tests.
